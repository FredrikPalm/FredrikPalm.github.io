# LD36
Simple survival adventure game for Ludum Dare

Ludum Dare version: http://fpalm.se/ld36

Current version: http://fpalm.se/amru

Latest dev version: http://fpalm.se/amrudev

Note that the original compo version code is in the compo branch.

The theme was Ancient Technology, so the game is vaguely set in a world where technology is primitive.

You play a family of nomads in a cold winter, trying to survive with only their deer and primitive tools.
